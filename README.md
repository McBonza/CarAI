# CarAI
Self driving NPC car project.
Cars are placed on an infinitely generated road.
They are fitted with a state machine and sensors to drive along the road, change lanes and stop at signs without colliding.
A car's "personality" is tunable, and can be made more or less patient and more or less reckless, resulting in emerging behavior.
